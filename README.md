# Parwat Singh Anjana — Personal Website

This repository powers my academic and professional website, hosted at:

**https://parwatsingh.github.io**

The site presents my research work, publications, academic background, and ongoing projects in blockchain execution, parallelism, distributed systems, and transactional memory.

## About the Website

The website is a static site deployed via **GitHub Pages** and generated without any external static-site generator.  
All content is written in HTML, CSS, and lightweight JavaScript.  
The goal is to maintain a simple, fast-loading, and easily maintainable academic profile page.

Key sections include:

- Home / Introduction  
- Education  
- Publications (Journals, Conferences, Posters)  
- Professional Experience and Recent Work  
- Achievements, Services, and Associations  
- CV and External Research Profiles

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

The site is deployed using GitHub Pages with:

- Source: `master` branch  
- Root directory as the publishing source  
- Optional `.nojekyll` file to disable Jekyll processing

If GitHub Pages requires a build step, Actions must be enabled in:

```
Settings → Actions → General → Allow all actions
```

After that, any commit pushed to the `master` branch automatically updates the live website.
